Q1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please try and keep track pf how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just need a rough idea.)

Answer: It took roughly 16 hours do to this assessment, I did not keep track of the time for each individual question. However, it was roughly 2 hour each. 

Q2. What online resources have you used? (My lectures, Youtube, Stack overflow etc.)

Answer: Links that were shared in the doc, W3 school, O'Reilly, ChatGPT (to break down the questions and explain what they meant and to break them down step by step for me).

Q3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

Answer: No I did not, however I probably should have. 

Q4. Did you need to ask questions to any instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how h=many help sessions did you require)?

Answer: No I did not, however I probably should have.

Q5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of making this all from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that you've completed this one.

Answer: I don't feel confident at all. This assignment has taken much longer than any other assignment I have had so far to complete. I felt directionless and needed to seek out multiple resources to help me, and even after all the research I could possibly do I still felt as though I didn't do it completely on my own. If asked to redo this assignment again, with the exact same questions without looking at outside resources to help, I would not be able to replicate it. Let alone something different yet similar.
